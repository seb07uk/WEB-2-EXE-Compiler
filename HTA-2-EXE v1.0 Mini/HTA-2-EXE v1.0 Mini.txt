What is HTA-EXE Converter?
HTA-EXE Converter is a GUI desktop tool for Windows that wraps any .hta (HTML Application) file — or an entire HTA project folder — into a single, self-contained .exe executable.

The resulting .exe:

Requires no Python installed on the target machine
Requires no separate files — all assets are bundled inside
Runs the HTA via the Windows built-in mshta.exe engine
Can carry full Windows VERSIONINFO metadata (version, company, copyright)
Can be optionally compressed with UPX to reduce file size
It is designed for developers, IT professionals, and power users who build HTA-based tools and want to distribute them as clean, professional .exe files.

Step-by-step internally:

All project files are collected (.hta, .html, .css, .js, .json, .xml, images, fonts, etc.)
External <script src="..."> and <link href="..."> references are automatically inlined into the HTA source — no broken references at runtime
All files are base64-encoded and embedded into a Python wrapper script
PyInstaller --onefile --noconsole compiles the wrapper into a single .exe
Windows VERSIONINFO resource is injected via a version_info.txt file
Optionally, UPX compresses the result
Requirements
Requirement	Details
OS	Windows 7 / 8 / 10 / 11 (64-bit recommended)
Python	3.10 or newer (must be in PATH)
PyInstaller	pip install pyinstaller — required
Pillow	pip install pillow — optional, needed for .png / .jpg / .bmp icons
UPX	Optional — place upx.exe next to the app or in PATH
mshta.exe	Built into Windows — required on the target machine to run the generated EXE
⚠️ Python must be installed on the machine running HTA-EXE Converter. The generated .exe does not require Python on the target.

Installation
HTA-EXE Converter does not require installation. Just run the script:

bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install pyinstaller
pip install pillow        # optional

# 2. Run
python HTA-2-EXE.py
Or double-click HTA-EXE Converter 1.0 Mini.exe if you have the pre-built version.

Quick Start
Launch the application
Click File… or Folder… next to HTA File/Folder and select your .hta file or project folder
Optionally set an Output Folder (defaults to the HTA's own directory)
Optionally pick an Icon
Click ▶ Convert
When done, click 📁 EXE Folder to open the output location
That's it — your .exe is ready.

User Interface — Full Reference
Banner & Title Bar
The animated banner at the top of the window displays:

Application name — HTA → EXE Converter mini
Subtitle — polsoft.ITS™ dev tools
Aero Glass visual effect with animated neon scan line, particle sparks, and a pulsing status dot in the EXE badge
The title bar shows: HTA-EXE Converter 1.0 Mini by Sebastian Januchowski

📂 HTA File / Folder
Label: HTA File/Folder

This is the primary input — the source of your HTA application.

Button	Action
File…	Opens a file picker filtered to .hta, .html, .htm files. Use this for single-file HTA apps.
Folder…	Opens a folder picker. Use this for multi-file HTA projects with separate CSS, JS, and image assets.
What gets collected when you select a folder:

The converter recursively scans the folder for all files with these extensions:

text
.hta  .html  .htm  .css  .js  .json  .xml
.png  .jpg  .jpeg  .gif  .ico  .svg  .bmp
.woff  .woff2  .ttf  .eot  .txt  .md
The entry point is determined automatically: the first .hta file found takes priority, then .html, then .htm.

💡 Tip: If your project has a specific entry point, name it with .hta extension so it is picked up first.

📁 Output Folder
Label: Output Folder

The directory where the finished .exe will be saved.

Click Browse… to select a folder
If left empty, the output goes to the same folder as the input HTA
The path is remembered between sessions
🖼 Icon
Label: Icon

Sets the icon embedded into the .exe file (visible in Explorer, taskbar, etc.).

Format	Requirements
.ico	Works directly, no extra dependencies
.png	Requires Pillow (pip install pillow)
.jpg / .jpeg	Requires Pillow
.bmp	Requires Pillow
When you pick a non-ICO image, the converter:

Opens it with Pillow
Converts to RGBA
Generates a multi-resolution .ico with sizes: 16×16, 24×24, 32×32, 48×48, 64×64, 128×128, 256×256
Passes the .ico to PyInstaller
A thumbnail preview of the icon is shown next to the path field after selection.

⚠️ If Pillow is not installed and you select a non-ICO file, the icon is silently skipped — the EXE will use the default Python icon. A warning appears in the Log.

📦 UPX Compression
Label: UPX

UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables) is an open-source executable compressor that can significantly reduce the size of the generated .exe.

Checkbox: compress EXE (--best --lzma)

When checked, after PyInstaller finishes, UPX runs on the output .exe with maximum compression:

text
upx --best --lzma YourApp.exe
How UPX is located (auto-detection order):

upx.exe in the same folder as HTA-EXE Converter
upx / upx.exe anywhere in the system PATH
The status indicator next to the checkbox shows:

✔ green — UPX found, path displayed
✘ red — UPX not found, compression will be skipped even if checked
Typical compression results: 40–70% size reduction depending on content.

💡 Download UPX from upx.github.io and place upx.exe next to the converter.

▶ Convert Button
The main action button. Starts the conversion process.

What happens when you click Convert:

Input path is validated (must exist)
If output .exe already exists → confirmation dialog ("Overwrite?")
Log is cleared
A background thread starts the conversion (UI stays responsive)
Progress bar animates (neon cyan indeterminate)
Elapsed time counter starts in the status bar
On success → success dialog + 📁 EXE Folder button activates
On error → error dialog with details in the Log
While converting, the button shows ⏳ Converting… and is disabled.

📁 EXE Folder Button
Opens the output folder in Windows Explorer, directly to the folder containing the generated .exe.

Disabled until a successful conversion has been completed in the current session
If the last EXE file still exists on disk, it navigates to its exact parent folder
Falls back to the Output Folder path if the file is no longer there
📋 Metadata Panel
Click 📋 Metadata to expand the metadata form. Click again (shows ▲) to collapse it.

The metadata is embedded into the .exe as a standard Windows VERSIONINFO resource, visible in File → Properties → Details in Explorer.

Field	Description	Example
App name	Internal name and product name of the EXE	MyTool
Version (x.x.x.x)	Four-part version number	1.2.0.0
Company	Company or author name	polsoft.ITS™ London
Description	Short description shown in file properties	HTA application compiled to EXE
Copyright	Copyright string	© 2026 Sebastian Januchowski
All fields are optional. If left blank, the VERSIONINFO block is omitted entirely.

The metadata settings are saved between sessions automatically.

Log Window
The log panel shows real-time output from the conversion process.

Color-coded messages:

Color	Tag	Meaning
🔵 Cyan	[INFO]	Informational steps (collecting files, inlining, PyInstaller progress)
🟡 Yellow	[WARN]	Non-fatal warnings (UPX not found, icon skipped, etc.)
🔴 Red	[ERROR] / ✘	Errors that stopped the conversion
🟢 Green	✔	Success confirmation
The log automatically scrolls to the latest message and keeps the last 200 lines.

Status Bar
The bottom bar shows application state at a glance:

Element	Description
● dot	Green = ready, orange/pulsing = converting, red = error
Status text	Current state: Ready, Converting…, Cancelled, or the EXE filename
Filename	Name of the file being processed or last generated EXE
⏱ Timer	Elapsed time during conversion (MM:SS)
ⓘ	Opens the About dialog
❓	Opens the Help dialog
EN / PL badge	Switches interface language
📍 / 📌 pin	Toggles Always on Top mode
EXE Metadata (Windows VERSIONINFO)
The metadata panel generates a VSVersionInfo block compatible with PyInstaller's --version-file option. It creates a proper Windows PE resource with both StringFileInfo and VarFileInfo sections.

Fields embedded:

text
CompanyName       → Company field
FileDescription   → Description field
FileVersion       → Version field (string)
InternalName      → App name field
LegalCopyright    → Copyright field
OriginalFilename  → App name + .exe
ProductName       → App name field
ProductVersion    → Version field (string)
filevers          → Version as tuple (major, minor, patch, build)
prodvers          → Same as filevers
Version format: Must be major.minor.patch.build (e.g., 1.0.0.0). If fewer parts are given, zeros are appended. If the format is invalid, it falls back to (1, 0, 0, 0).

UPX Compression — Deep Dive
UPX compression happens after PyInstaller builds the EXE. The converter runs:

text
upx --best --lzma output.exe
--best selects the highest compression level. --lzma uses the LZMA algorithm which typically achieves better ratios than the default.

After compression, the Log reports:

text
[INFO] UPX: 8420 KB → 3210 KB (saved 5210 KB, 38.1% of original)
Notes:

UPX return code 1 is treated as success (already-compressed files)
If UPX fails, the EXE is still delivered — just uncompressed
Some antivirus software may flag UPX-compressed executables as suspicious (false positive). This is a known UPX limitation.
Asset Bundling & Inlining
CSS & JavaScript Inlining
Before bundling, the converter scans the HTA source for external references and inlines them directly:

html
<!-- Before inlining -->
<script src="logic.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<!-- After inlining -->
<script>
  /* contents of logic.js */
</script>
<style>
  /* contents of style.css */
</style>
This ensures the HTA runs correctly from a temporary directory without any path issues. External URLs (http://, https://, //) are left untouched.

Binary Assets
Images, fonts, and other binary files are base64-encoded and embedded as string literals inside the Python wrapper. At runtime, they are decoded and written to a temporary directory before mshta.exe is called.

Temp Directory Lifecycle
text
App launches → Creates temp dir (hta_app_XXXX) → Extracts all files
                                                         ↓
                                              mshta.exe runs the HTA
                                                         ↓
                                    App exits → atexit cleans up temp dir
Settings Persistence
The converter saves your settings automatically to:

text
%APPDATA%\hta2exe_gui\settings.json
Saved settings include:

Last used output folder
UPX enabled/disabled state and path
Metadata fields (name, version, company, description, copyright)
Window geometry (size and position)
Interface language (PL / EN)
Always on Top state
Settings are restored on next launch.

Language Switching
The interface supports Polish and English. Click the EN or PL badge in the bottom-right of the status bar to switch.

The entire UI rebuilds instantly — all labels, buttons, dialogs, and log messages switch language. Your form data is preserved during the rebuild.

The selected language is saved to settings and restored on next launch.

Always on Top
Click the 📍 pin icon in the status bar to toggle Always on Top mode.

📍 (unpinned) — normal window behaviour
📌 (pinned) — the converter window stays above all other windows
State is saved and restored between sessions.

Troubleshooting
Layout Horizontal.Neon.TProgressbar not found
Your Python/Tkinter version requires ttk styles to be initialized differently. Make sure you are running the latest version of HTA-EXE Converter which initializes the style in App.__init__() using the built-in TProgressbar name.

No module named 'PyInstaller'
PyInstaller is not installed. Run:

bash
pip install pyinstaller
Permission Error / WinError 5
The output .exe is currently running. Close it before trying to overwrite with a new build.

mshta.exe not found (on target machine)
The generated EXE calls mshta.exe which is part of Windows. It is present on all standard Windows installations. On Windows Server Core or stripped-down images it may be missing or disabled by Group Policy.

Icon is ignored / default Python icon used
Either Pillow is not installed (for non-ICO formats) or the icon file path is invalid. Check the Log for [WARN] messages about the icon.

UPX not found
Place upx.exe in the same folder as HTA-2-EXE.py (or the converter EXE), or add its directory to the system PATH. The status bar shows ✔ when UPX is detected.

Conversion succeeds but the EXE crashes on target machine
Make sure the target machine has mshta.exe available
If your HTA uses ActiveX or COM objects, they must be registered on the target machine
Check that your HTA does not reference external files by absolute path — all assets must be in the project folder so they get bundled
ValueError: empty range in randrange (animation crash)
Resize the application window to be wider — this was a bug in earlier builds where particles would crash on very narrow windows. Fixed in current version with max() guards.

FAQ
Q: Does the generated EXE require Python on the target machine? A: No. PyInstaller packages everything needed. Only mshta.exe (built into Windows) is required.

Q: Can I convert a multi-file HTA project (with CSS, JS, images)? A: Yes. Select the project folder instead of a single file. All supported assets are collected and bundled automatically.

Q: Will my HTA's JavaScript and CSS work correctly? A: Yes. External script and stylesheet references are inlined before bundling, so relative paths work as expected.

Q: Can I use a PNG or JPG as the EXE icon? A: Yes, if Pillow is installed (pip install pillow). The image is auto-converted to a multi-resolution .ico.

Q: How much does UPX compress the EXE? A: Typically 40–70%, depending on content. A 10 MB EXE may compress to 3–5 MB.

Q: Can I run the converter itself as an EXE (frozen)? A: Yes. When running frozen, the converter detects this and searches PATH for a real Python interpreter to run PyInstaller, since sys.executable would otherwise point to itself.

Q: Where are settings saved? A: %APPDATA%\hta2exe_gui\settings.json

Q: Can I use this on non-Windows systems? A: The converter's UI will run on any OS with Python + Tkinter. However, the generated EXE targets Windows only (relies on mshta.exe).

Q: My antivirus flags the generated EXE. Is it a virus? A: No. PyInstaller-generated executables are commonly flagged as false positives, especially when UPX-compressed. This is a known industry issue. Submit the file to your AV vendor as a false positive.

Technical Notes
Conversion runs in a background thread — the GUI remains fully responsive during long builds
Temp directory is created via tempfile.mkdtemp() and always cleaned up via atexit, even on crash
PyInstaller flags used: --onefile (single EXE), --noconsole (no terminal window), --distpath (output location), --workpath (build artifacts in temp)
CSS/JS inlining uses regex matching on <script src="..."> and <link href="..."> patterns; only local references are inlined
Base64 overhead: Binary assets increase ~33% in the wrapper source; PyInstaller then compresses the bundle further
Python discovery when frozen: Searches python, python3, then py (Windows Launcher) in PATH
UPX return code 1 is treated as success — UPX exits 1 when the file is already compressed or compression is not beneficial
Log retention: The log widget keeps a maximum of 200 lines to avoid memory growth during very verbose builds
